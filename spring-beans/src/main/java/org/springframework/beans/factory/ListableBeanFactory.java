/**
 * BeanFactory接口的扩展，由可以枚举其所有bean实例的bean工厂实现，而不是根据客户机的请求逐
 * 个尝试bean查找。预加载所有bean定义的BeanFactory实现（例如基于XML的工厂）可以实现这个接口。
 *
 * 如果这是一个HierarchicalBeanFactory，那么返回值将不考虑任何BeanFactory层次结构，而是
 * 只与当前工厂中定义的bean相关。使用BeanFactoryUtils助手类也可以考虑祖先工厂中的bean。
 *
 * 这个接口中的方法将只考虑这个工厂的bean定义。它们将忽略任何已通过其他方法（如ConfigurableBeanFactory
 * 的registerSingleton方法）注册的单例bean，但GetBeanNameForType和getBeansOfType除外，
 * 它们也将检查这些手动注册的单例。当然，BeanFactory的getBean也允许对这种特殊bean进行透明访问。
 * 然而，在典型的场景中，所有bean都将由外部bean定义，所以大多数应用程序不需要担心这种差异。
 *
 * 注意：除了getBeanDefinitionCount和containsBeanDefinition之外，此接口中的方法不是为频
 * 繁调用而设计的。实现可能很慢。
 *
 * Extension of the {@link BeanFactory} interface to be implemented by bean factories
 * that can enumerate all their bean instances, rather than attempting bean lookup
 * by name one by one as requested by clients. BeanFactory implementations that
 * preload all their bean definitions (such as XML-based factories) may implement
 * this interface.
 *
 * <p>If this is a {@link HierarchicalBeanFactory}, the return values will <i>not</i>
 * take any BeanFactory hierarchy into account, but will relate only to the beans
 * defined in the current factory. Use the {@link BeanFactoryUtils} helper class
 * to consider beans in ancestor factories too.
 *
 * <p>The methods in this interface will just respect bean definitions of this factory.
 * They will ignore any singleton beans that have been registered by other means like
 * {@link org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableBeanFactory}'s
 * {@code registerSingleton} method, with the exception of
 * {@code getBeanNamesForType} and {@code getBeansOfType} which will check
 * such manually registered singletons too. Of course, BeanFactory's {@code getBean}
 * does allow transparent access to such special beans as well. However, in typical
 * scenarios, all beans will be defined by external bean definitions anyway, so most
 * applications don't need to worry about this differentiation.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> With the exception of {@code getBeanDefinitionCount}
 * and {@code containsBeanDefinition}, the methods in this interface
 * are not designed for frequent invocation. Implementations may be slow.
